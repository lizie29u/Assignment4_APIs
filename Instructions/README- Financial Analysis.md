Based on our calcutions, we are 90% confident that the cumulative return of this portfolio will fall between $102.83 and $379.34. at the end of 30 years .

(show cumulative returns bar chart)

The mean cumulative return is expected to be $199.08


For an initial investment of $20,000, the expected mean return will be $3,981,677.  We are 80% certain that this investment will return between $2,380,549 and $6,411,230. (that is  at the 1oth and 90th percentiles)

When compared with the plaid analysis, a 4% withdrawal rate from this portfolio will be approximately $95, 221.  This will be more than the projected annual income from the budget analysis, which is $6,085

A 50 % increase in the initial investment, woukd result in a withdrawal rate of $ $142,832, which is an increase of 50%.  Therefore the percentage increase in investment would result in an equal percentage increase in the returns.

in conclusion, based on our analysis, below is the expected portfolio performnace over the next 30 years
